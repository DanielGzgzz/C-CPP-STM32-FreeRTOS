# C-CPP-STM32-FreeRTOS

**Date:** 19/9/2023

## Project Overview

This project involves the use of the STM32 Nucleo - F746GZ development board, a joystick, and a buzzer. The pins for the joystick and buzzer are configured in the `.ioc` file.

## Features

- **STM32 Nucleo - F746GZ:** The project is designed to run on the STM32 Nucleo - F746GZ development board, leveraging its capabilities for embedded system development.

- **Joystick Integration:** A joystick is incorporated into the project, providing an input mechanism for user interaction. The specific pins for the joystick are configured in the `.ioc` file.

- **Buzzer Integration:** A buzzer is included in the project to provide audible feedback or signaling. The pins for the buzzer are also configured in the `.ioc` file Controlled by PWM.

## Project Structure

Utilizing FreeRTOS ADC_TO_PWM  TASK and CPP code as a proof of concept to read values exploiting interrupts , changing the PWM Frequency when the duty cycle is DOWN

## Development Environment

ALL have been done in the STM32IDE


## Running the Project

Make the board according to the ioc, you'll need a compatible joystick, and buzzer, jumper cables , upload the software, and run.



## Acknowledgments

Built with FreeRTOS
